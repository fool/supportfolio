<h1>Chris "fool" McCraw's SupportFolio</h1>
<h2>I like to help.  Here, I demonstrate how I like to help, and some of the results it can bring.</h2>

<h3>Helping organizations grow sustainable and effective Support organizations</h3>
<p><b>Got a problem? Helping customers is my "why", but providing good customer service goes far deeper than just that.</b>
<br>
<br>
Starting and scaling a Support team in a growing company on a budget is a challenge, but we can build a good roadmap for it!  I love helping companies start on and build that path.  I am available to present and consult for companies of any size and any resource level. 
<br>

<span class=callout-box>Check out <b><a href=building_support.shtml>some points this work will touch on, as well as examples of writings and presentations on related topics</a></b>.</span>
</p>

<h3>Some demonstrations of my work and customer reactions</h3>

<h4>In my own words</h4>
<p><b><a href=in_my_words.shtml>Some of my better responses to customer questions, in context</a></b>, from a community forum I helped out in while working at New Relic, and again in my current role at Netlify.</p>

<h4>In my customers' words</h4>
<p>Sometimes people bother to fill out those "was this support interaction useful?" surveys after a support contact/case is completed.  <b><a href=in_their_words.shtml>Here are a few choice excerpts.</a></b></p>

<hr>

<h3>Presentations and related writings</h3>

<p>I like to speak on the topic of Support at conferences.  I also occasionally write technical documentation and blog posts for my company. <b><a href=presentations.shtml>I've catalogued some of this work here.</a></b></p>


<p>I believe strongly in mentorship as a teaching tool.  It can be challenging to apply in small doses, but I wrote up one way I started doing it on a team where I was the only senior tech support engineer. This workflow was adopted by the rest of the senior staff as they were promoted/hired. I wrote up some best practices around how we did it in <b><a href=peer_reviews.html>The art of constructive peer reviews</a></b>.</p>

<p>I've developed or led many initiatives to improve team and company workflows, such as:
	<ul>
	<li><b><a href=bestpractices.html>Best practices for answering tickets</a></b>.</li>
	<li>Team building.  For instance, <b><a href=liaison.html>how to be an effective liaison to other teams within the company</a></b>.</li>
	<li>Representing the customer point of view to other teams like Development, Ops, Security, Product Management, and Sales.  I've written up some <b><a href=bug_escalation.html>guidelines for gentle but effective bug escalation</a></b> and I gave a talk on this general pattern in 2016: <a href=beyond.html>Working Across the Company</a>.</li>
	<li>Team growth - I presented a DIY philosophy that costs $0 and creates new leaders and growth opportunities for your team: <b><a href=garden.html>Growing your Team: A Garden Philosophy</a></b>.</li>
	<li>Compassion for customers: I always strive to present as a trusted advisor, rather than a technician or an employee.  This often involves a frank admission of the limitations of the platform, but regardless I strive to make the customer feel like part of a community on a shared journey, rather than like someone we're just using for their money.  In this vein my <b><a href=boothbabe_notes.html>talk on giving good demos</a></b> has some useful thoughts.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>And Then...</h3>
<p>While I haven't written any public posts on these topics, I believe they are key to an effictive, holistic Support experience:
<ul>
	<li>Providing internal support - helping new hires inside and outside of support find information and understanding existing organizational structure and processes.  Part of this work is building internal knowledge bases that are useful to peers and colleagues beyond the Support team.</li>
	<li>Compassion for peers: I help onboard every new tech support employee in companies I work at - and most developers too!  With training and/or pairing, I cushion their landing at a new place with a dizzying array of technologies.
</ul>
