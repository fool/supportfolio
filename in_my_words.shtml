<h2>In my (customer facing) words</h2>
<p>These are some of my better answers to customers, visible many years later thanks to two public community forums I've participated in (where the Support team steps in to answer questions that benefit from an expert's touch.)
<p>
<h3>Netlify</h3>
<p>At <a href=https://www.netlify.com>Netlify</a>, I've written a substantial percentage of our seed content and responded to a large number of our customers' queries.  
<ul>
<li> I wrote <a href=https://answers.netlify.com/search?q=@fool%20%22%5BSupport%20Guide%5D%22>a lot of FAQ's and best practice guides</a> which were referred to by customers of all account levels, and often linked from the official documentation or even the service's administrative UI.
<li> <a href=https://community.netlify.com/u/fool/notifications/likes-received>Here's a list of posts that were appreciated by customers and colleagues.</a>
</ul>

<h3>New Relic</h3>
<p>From my days at <a href=https://www.newrelic.com>New Relic</a>, I've collected a baker's dozen of my favorite responses below, in no particular order.  Since New Relic have moved the forums' layout around, these may be hard to read and I can no longer link directly to my own answers in a bit thread, but you're looking for responses from "fool".
