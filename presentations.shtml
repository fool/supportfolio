<h1>Presentations and Articles</h1>
<p>I enjoy talking and writing about problem solving and customer service/technical support, and have helped several friends bootstrap Support programs in their startups.  
<p>
<span class=callout-box>I consult and present on these topics and <a href=building_support.shtml>you can read more about those services here</a>.</span>
<p>
I've also run user groups and organized dozens of tech events from workshops to unconferences, including in an organizational role at conferences like <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224124427/http://barcampportland.org/>BarCamp Portland</a>, and <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114190913/http://www.opensourcebridge.org/>Open Source Bridge</a>.

<h3>Writings</h3>
<ul>
<li>I sometimes write up tech notes for internal consumption.  <a href=statuspage.html>Here's an example I wrote about effective use of status pages for your service.</a>

<li>I wrote some, and advised on many, of New Relic's public-facing documentation articles.
