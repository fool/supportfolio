I enjoy talking and writing about problem solving, and have helped several friends bootstrap Support programs in their startups.  I've also run user groups and organized dozens of tech events from workshops to unconferences, including in an organizational role at conferences like <a href=http://barcampportland.org/>BarCamp Portland</a>, and <a href=http://opensourcebridge.org/>Open Source Bridge</a>.
<p>
I've presented a few times in front of an audience lately about topics relevant to the kind of work I enjoy doing.  Most of these appearances are catalogued on <a href=http://lanyrd.com/profile/gently-7036/>Lanyrd.com</a>, and the notes and slide decks are linked below.

I've written some, and advised on many, of New Relic's public-facing documentation articles.  Here's the crunchiest one I wrote: <a href=https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/reports/service-level-agreements/api-examples-sla-reports>API examples for SLA reports</a>.

I occasionally <a href=http://blog.newrelic.com/author/chris-mccraw/>wrote for New Relic's company blog on technical or social themes.</a>
<p>
I sometimes write up tech notes for internal consumption.  <a href=statuspage.html>Here's an example I wrote about effective use of status pages for your service.</a>
